That's what's so powerful and exciting about
this programming paradigm. It's more than just a new way of doing the same old thing. It opens up new possibilities that were infeasible
to do before. So in the next few minutes, I'm going to show you
the basics of creating a neural network which is the workhorse of doing this type
of pattern recognition. A neural network is just a slightly more
advanced implementation of machine learning and we
call that deep learning. But fortunately it's
actually very easy to code. So, we're just going to jump
straight into deep learning. We'll start with a simple one
and then we'll move on to one that does computer vision in about 10 lines of code. But let's start with a very
simple "Hello World" example. So you can see just how
everything hangs together.
